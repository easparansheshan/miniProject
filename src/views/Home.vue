      <p class="col-8 para">
        Sri Lanka is truly spellbinding and will suit any traveler’s interests
        with its top tourist attractions. The small island nation is chock-full
        of adventure activities like surfing and trekking. There are several
        highly religious sites for the religious devotee, and unbelievable
        historical tourist attractions for history buffs in Sri Lanka. However,
        no one can dispute Sri Lanka’s incredible natural beauty. Whether it be
        en-route to a perfect surf break, visiting a historical site or on a
        pilgrimage, lush greenery and exotic animals are never far away
      </p>

      <h2>2.Adam's Peak</h2>
      <p class="col-4">

      </p>
      <p class="col-8 para">
        At the summit of Adam’s Peak is a footprint cast in stone. It has
        spiritual significance to a number of different religions, however,
        there is currently a Buddhist monastery at the summit. To the Buddhists,
        the footprint is that of Buddha’s; to Christians, the footprint is
        Adam’s; and to Hindus, the footprint is attributed to Shiva. The site is
        a popular place of pilgrimage, especially on full moon nights. The trek
        to the top of the mountain to see the footprint is via a steep staircase
        containing over 5000 steps. The trail is lined with many tea stalls and
        food shops which act as places of rest. Most people begin their hike at
        2:30 am to reach the summit in time for sunrise.

      <h2>3.Galle Fort</h2>
      <p class="col-8 para">
        It is easy to get lost in the cobblestoned alleyways and streets within
        Galle Fort. Today the area is full of modern restaurants, hotels,
        clothing, and souvenir shops. Meanwhile, snake charmers and buskers line
        the seawall. However, the fort was not always such a cosmopolitan spot.
        A basic fort was constructed by the Portuguese when they made their
        first landing to the island in 1505. When the Dutch eventually seized
        control of Galle, they made a number of improvements; including the
        enormous sea wall that still lines the fort. Galle Fort is an excellent
        example of what the synthesis between European and Asian architecture
        looks like.

      <h2>4.Yala National Park</h2>
      <p class="col-4">
        <img src="../assets/Images/2.jpg" height="300px" alt="" />
      </p>
      <p class="col-8 para">
        Yala National Park is made up of spellbinding vistas and a true
        abundance of Sri Lankan wildlife. It has the highest density of leopards
        in the world, so chances of seeing them are very high. Although leopards
        are the main attraction here, they are followed closely by elephants,
        sloth bears and crocodiles. The park is divided into five blocks; some
        of which were zoned to hunters until Yala became a national park in
        1938. Ensure you make time to visit the very informative visitor center
        at the entrance of the park for insightful displays about the area.

      <h2>5.Sigiriya Rock Fort</h2>
      <p class="col-8 para">
        Sigiriya Rock Fort is utterly impressive. The rock walls rise up 200
        meters from the ground, only to give way to a flat plateau at their
        summit. There are steep stairwells to reach the top and many frescos to
        marvel at on the way up. At the top, you can find the remains of an
        ancient civilization, including relics of a palace and monastery. It
        would have taken true engineering ingenuity to build a structure at this
        height so many centuries ago. Around the rock fort are many important
        caves and gardens; impressively, they are some of the first landscaped
        gardens in the world.
